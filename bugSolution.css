Instead of relying on `!important`, reorganize your CSS to ensure that styles are applied in the correct order. Use more specific selectors to achieve the desired behavior without resorting to `!important`. Here's a revised approach:

```css
.special div {
  color: green;
}

div {
  color: blue; 
}

.special {
  color: red; /* This will be overridden by the more specific rule above */
}
```

This version prioritizes the most specific selector first to eliminate the need for `!important`. Always aim to resolve specificity conflicts through well-structured and well-ordered CSS.
