# CSS Specificity and !important Issues
This repository demonstrates common issues related to CSS specificity and the overuse of `!important`.  The `bug.css` file shows an example of unexpected behavior due to specificity, while `bugSolution.css` shows a better approach that avoids unnecessary `!important` rules.  The solution focuses on proper selector organization and prioritization for better maintainability and readability.
