The CSS specificity can be a source of unexpected behavior.  For example, consider the following:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

.special div {
  color: green; /* This will override the other styles due to higher specificity */
}
```

In this case, even though the `div` selector is more general, the `.special div` selector has higher specificity because it is more specific.

Another issue is using `!important` excessively, which overrides any other styles, making it hard to maintain and debug.
